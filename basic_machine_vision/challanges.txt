         Python Exersize to Learn Basic Machine Langauge

Dependencies: 
   - Python 2.7.x
   - PIL (or Pillow)

Note: Make copy of the file template.py for each challange.

Challenges:
   0. Run template.py and understand what it does

   1. Modify the program to print the x and y of the white dot

   2. Modify the program to read the file "32_32_3white_dot.bmp"
      and print the x and y of the middle dot.
      NOTE: this file is black/white. This means that 'putpixel' expect one value 
         and that 'getpixel' will return a single value.

   3. Same for the orange in "orange.JPG".
      Advanced challenge: find the center of the orange

   4. Put a white line on the image "32_32_3white_dot.bmp" and display the image.
      The line should start from 0,0 (upper right corner) and end at 31,31 (lower left corner)

   5. Do the same on the image "32_32_red_dot.bmp" with out touching the red line.
      It is Ok for the line not to be straight BUT it must start and end at the right places
      The software should work also for different locations of the red line w/o modifications.

   6. Do the same for the image "32_32_red_corner.bmp"

   7. Find the center of the triangle in the image "rect_tri_cir.bmp"

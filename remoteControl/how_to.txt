Components Used in the Remote Control and How to Connect Them
=============================================================

Terminal: Connects the two wires from the battery holder to the PCB.
    Note: Mark the + and - so you will be able to tell where to connect the black/red wires.
    Note: The battery + is called Vcc. The battery - is called Ground.

Capacitor: Connects to Vcc and to Ground. Stabilizes the voltage.
    Note: Mark the + on the PCB.

Microprocessor: Runs software that sends message to the robot using the RF module.
    Find by searching for component "PIC12F675_P":wq
    Sends a message when one of the keys are pressed.
    Microprocessor leg function list:
       - Leg number 1 connects to Vcc and leg number 8 to Ground.
       - Legs number 2, 3, 5 and 6 are connected to the switches; they are inputs.
       - Leg number 7 is connected to the RF module (pin 2) AND to the LED-resistor.      
       - Leg number 4 is not used.
    Note: Since the microprocessor needs to be available for software updates, it is not soldered directly to the PCB.
          Instead, a socket is soldered to the PCB and the microprocessor is inserted into the socket.
          This does not affect the PCB or the schematic.

LED and LED-resistor:
    The LED-resistor is connected to the microprocessor (leg 7) and to the + of the LED.
    The + of the LED is connected to the LED-resistor and the - to ground.
    Note: The resistor's function is to limit the current that passes through the LED.

RF module:
    The RF module sends information from the microprocessor to the robot as radio waves.
    RF module leg function list:
       - Leg number 3 connects to Vcc and leg number 4 to Ground.
       - Leg number 2 is connected to the microprocessor (leg 7).
       - Leg number 1 is not used.
    Note: you have to solder an antenna to the RF module. This does not affect the PCB.
